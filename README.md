# #OpenAccess, now what? -- half-day data hackathon at #MCN2017

> This year MCN will focus on how museums can use technology to innovate and emphasize transparency, individual action, and institutional bravery. (from the MCN2017 call for proposals)

## Title: #OpenAccess, now what?

Get your hands on datasets, text-mining, data-mining, dataviz tools and tricks.
A #MCN50/#MCN2017 data hackathon for museum technologists @MuseumCN.

## Format

- a half-day hackathon before the conference
- a follow-up session during the conference to present the results

in [others](http://mcn.edu/category-unpacked-mcn2017-call-proposals/) category

## What?

This is a hands-on data crunching session.

This isn't a workshop (there isn't one workshop leader, each  participant is bringing and learning something) but it rather takes the shape of a hackathon where all participants share tips and techniques and produce a few stunning presentations by the end of the day.

Some results will be presented in a session during the conference.


## Take-aways for "datathon" participants

- Evaluation => What can your data tell you about your visitors and your collection? How can this feed your digital strategy?

- Data-led storytelling => Can data help you decide where to focus your interpretation efforts?

- Data-backed storytelling => How can data not lead but strengthen and support your narratives? 

- Accessibility => How can you increase accessibility with big data and machine learning? (eg. reducing costs of translations)

- Strategy/etc => What do you get from "opening" your collection? Feedback from institutions that have just done it.

One of the principles of data science is that it has to be reproducible. So, one outcome could be to share a repository of tools on GitHub. A data toolkit that can be applied to "any" museum dataset.


## When?

- Hackathon from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM Tuesday, November 07, 2017, at [CMP_studio](https://twitter.com/CMP_studio)
  **IMPORTANT : as the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History are closed on Tuesdays, please confirm to get access to CMP Studio**

- Presentation of the results from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM Friday, November 10, 2017 at #MCN2017.

## How?

- a series of short lightning talks where participants present tools or techniques they use, and how they use them, to feed the discussion
- participants/groups choose to apply some of these tools and techniques to a dataset


## Who?

2 profiles:

- people at ease with programming and hacking code, be it with Java, Python, R, and/or dataviz techniques

- people who can bring a large dataset and are curious to explore it in a different way (eg. a collection of publications, labels, audio guide scripts etc.)
