# OpenAccess, now what?
A half-day data hackathon at #MCN2017.

Museum professionals are invited to get their hands on real-life datasets from other museums and share their experience dealing with open data.

Participants will work with datasets, text-mining, data-mining and dataviz tools to produce a few stunning presentations by the end of the day. 

## Take-aways
- Evaluation: What can your data tell you about your visitors and your collection? How can this feed your digital strategy?
- Data-led storytelling: Can data help you decide where to focus your interpretation efforts?
- Data-backed storytelling: How can data not lead but strengthen and support your narratives?
- Accessibility: How can you increase accessibility with big data and machine learning?
- Strategy: What do you get from "opening" your collection? Feedback from institutions that have just done it.
